## Available functions

This folder contains the names of the functions which will be identified by a call of the function `processFunctionName`. The literature functions are divided into files per dimension, as well as all being included in a single file `literatureBiSourceAll.txt`. The file `disturbanceFunctions.txt` contains a proposed set of new instances which takes a high fidelity function and adds a disturbance (i.e. an error) somewhere in the space. These are meant to be examples, as this can be applied to any function. Finally, subsets of certain sizes are given in the files `chosenTestSuiteN*.txt`, where `*` is the number of instances in the subset. These subsets are generated using instance measures (i.e. features) in order to generate as diverse a subset as possible.
